I am a Pre-doctoral research fellow in TCS Research working under the supervision of \href[Ramya Hebbalaguppe](https://rhebbalaguppe.github.io/). My research focuses on two primary areas. Firstly, lifelong learning, where I investigate techniques to enable AI systems to accumulate knowledge continuously, adapting to changing environments. Secondly, I am dedicated to advancing robust and reliable machine learning, aiming to enhance model stability and performance in real-world scenarios.
